## Placement Rules

- Prefer a business-function category over `others`.
- Use `custom` when the skill is tied to a specific company, project, user, or
  local environment.
- Use `custom/<subcategory>` when multiple internal skills share the same owner
  or purpose.
- Keep `name:` in `SKILL.md` globally unique even when a skill lives under a
  category directory.
- Do not create new top-level categories without updating this file in the same
  change.
